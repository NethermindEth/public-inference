# Public Inference Platform

A decentralized marketplace for funding and executing large-scale AI inference computations.

## Overview

Public Inference Platform enables democratic access to large-scale AI compute resources through a decentralized funding mechanism. Users can propose research projects, contribute funds, and leverage distributed inference capabilities across multiple AI models and providers.

## Key Features

- Permissionless project creation and funding
- Token-based governance for funded projects
- Automated workflow coordination for AI inference tasks
- Integration with multiple compute providers
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities
- Memoization and caching of computation results

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- Project registry and funding management
- Token distribution and governance
- Secure fund distribution to compute providers

### Web Interface
- Project discovery and leaderboard
- Contribution management
- Portfolio tracking

### Inference Layer
- Deterministic workflow coordinator
- Multi-provider compute backend integration
- Search and RAG capabilities
- Result caching and memoization

## Integration Points

- Support for major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Integration with decentralized compute markets
- Connection to external data sources and research repositories

## Contributing / Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Trust Model

The platform operates with the following trust assumptions:
- Verified compute providers
- Transparent fund management
- Open source coordination logic

## Current Status

Early development phase. Looking for contributors and feedback.

## Open Questions

- Provider inclusion criteria
- Differentiation from existing solutions
- Verification of compute execution
- Economic model refinement

## License

[TBD]
